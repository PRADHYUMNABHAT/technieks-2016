This document contains some guidelines that you will need to follow.
(1) Use proper indentation. Makes code readable and easy for other to understand and make changes (if any). Use and respect the <tag> heirarchey.
(2) All Javascipt files (.js) of a perticular webpage (ex. contact.html) goes into ./scripts-contact. 
(3) All stylesheets (.css) of a perticular webpage (ex. contact.html) go into ./styles-contact.
(4) Scripts (.js) and stylesheets (.css) that are common to all webpages (bootstrap) go into ./scripts-common and ./styles-common respectively.
(5) Images of respective webpages go into ./images-webpage folders, just like how it's with scripts and stylesheets. Common images go into ./images folder.
(6) Also, follow html rules. Always close the tags and use double quotes for all values. This isn't a guideline but a rule to be followed. 
(7) Same rules apply for JS and CSS. Use indentation and make sure the code is readable.
